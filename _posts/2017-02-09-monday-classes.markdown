Last Monday, I started teaching 2 groups. One is at 1pm the other was at 6pm. I feel you must have a good strong foundation when teaching with the subjects of Healing, Psychic development and Unfolding of mediumship.
Opening prayer was followed by explanation of the Universal Laws. and discussion of a variety of future topics and involving the group participation/interaction of future classes.
I also sent those who wanted more information on Universal Laws to a web site to go over what was explained in the class.
I know these classes will open up to the world of Intelligence, insight, and knowledge that we all can practice and learn from each other and from the universe.
see you next monday!
love and light
